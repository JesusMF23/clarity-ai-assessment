1- What are the main changes between the current and past results?

    After detecting duplicated pairs of: company_name+goal+version but with different matket cap and impact (for example MATCH GROUP, INC), assuming they are correct:

    The market cap has decreased by: -575367.7482678369

    The industry with highest market cap gap: ('Oil & Gas Drilling', -2186.133317259999)
    The industry with lowest market cap gap: ('Banks', -345524.6068224739)

    The impact has increased by: 542054.961013794

    The industry with highest impact gap: ('Airlines', 276535.48306759074)
    The industry with lowest impact gap: ('Health Care Services', 4177.815620422363)

    The goal with highest impact gap: ('13 - Climate change', 542262.6371152084)        
    The goal with lowest impact gap: ('03 - Health', -207.6761016845703)

    company_name                 goal  impact_current  impact_previous  impact_difference
    IND SWIFT LIMITED  13 - Climate change    -7405.275946     -5485.389590       -1919.886357
    MATCH GROUP, INC.  13 - Climate change     -374.556227      -300.039228         -74.516999
    MATCH GROUP, INC.  13 - Climate change     -300.039228      -374.556227          74.516999

    As results, we can observe that IND SWIFT LIMITED has a big differente in its impact. If we observe, MATCH GROUP, INC, we see changes in both directions, possitive and negative, 
    that may be associated with duplicated pairs.

2-Would you recommend to assess in more detail any of these changes? Why?

    Yes, I would recommend assessing why IND SWIFT LIMITED has such a high decrease. Also why MATCH GROUP, INC 
    has changes in possitive and negative for the same goal, might be some error on data source.

    I would also study in detail the entries for companies, just to verify why we have duplicated company_name+goal+version, 
    is this related to an issue in the data source? Are we meant to have only unique values? (as it happens with MATCH GROUP, INC)

    Another thing to review, is why we are having most negative impacts differente but we still have a possitive impact gap. This may show companies are going towards the correct direction 
    but we still have room for improvement, or otherwise that we have problems on our data.

3-If you believe that further assessments are needed, how would you prioritize them and why? What assessments would you propose?

    For the detailed assessment I would prioritize based on the following:
        1- Change: giving high priority to biggest changes, whether they are possitive or negative, they might be outliers that we need to correct.
        2- Company: are these companies that are "trendy" in stock market? We should focus for those companies that gather more attention by investors,
            otherwise the impact of any error on our system will lead to bad reputation of our product and reducing the NPS (apart from impact on reputation, stocks value, ...)
        3- Trens: do we observe these companies have an increasing or decreasing trend on their impact or maket cap during these years? 
            if we find something that gets far from their trend in these years, we might be having a problem

    Regarding assessments proposed, I will go with:
        1- Data Quality: I would perform several data quality analisis to verify the content that we have on our systems databases.
        2- Data Sources: Did some of our data source changed and theferoe causing bad data quality? it is important to be aware of changes 
            not only on the data structure of our sources, but also if they are still trustworthy or not. As we stated on question 1 and 2, 
            duplicated values are found, are these from data sources or is an issue of data quality?
        3- Regulations: we need to verify if there has been any regulation that forced a company to adopt measures that are not traditionally followed.

4-Apart from these changes, are there other things that worry you about the new dump?

    Current version stats:
    count    5.380000e+03
    mean     8.137574e+06
    std      2.499780e+07
    min     -2.460335e+07
    25%     -1.298330e+03
    50%     -3.243203e+02
    75%     -1.225537e+02
    max      3.643483e+08
    Previous version stats:
    count    5.518000e+03
    mean     7.933962e+06
    std      2.471590e+07
    min     -2.460335e+07
    25%     -1.298330e+03
    50%     -3.243203e+02
    75%     -1.354440e+02
    max      3.643483e+08

    The main concern after reviewing the stats, points to the same direction as already stated on previous questions. 
    The high value of the maximum is suggesting that we have a big impact of outliers and these may be causing problems on our metrics. Detailed analisis 
    must be completed to ensure data quality and consistency.

    Apart from it, as already mentioned in question 2. We need to review why are we having plenty of negative impacts and still have a possitive impact gap. Maybe we need to 
    revisit how we are measuring and specially how these results are interpreted not only by us but by our customers.
